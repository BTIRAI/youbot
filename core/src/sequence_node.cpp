                We want this thread detached so we can cancel its execution (when the action no longer receive ticks).
                Hence we cannot just call the method Tick() from the action as doing so will block the execution of the tree.
                For this reason if a child of this node is an action, then we send the tick using the tick engine. Otherwise we call the method Tick() and wait for the response.
